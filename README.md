# BitPredictor

This repository contains a Bitcoin price prediction model built using TensorFlow. The model is designed to predict future Bitcoin prices based on historical data.

## Overview

Bitcoin price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. This project leverages the power of TensorFlow to create a model that can analyze historical price data and make predictions about future prices. The model uses a time-series forecasting approach to predict Bitcoin prices, aiming to provide insights for traders and investors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and normalized to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: The model is built using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is well-suited for time-series forecasting.
- **Training**: The model is trained on historical Bitcoin price data.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Prediction**: The trained model can predict future Bitcoin prices based on the provided input data.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Milind-Ranjan/bitcoin-predictor.git
   cd bitcoin-predictor
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure that you have historical Bitcoin price data in a CSV file.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train the model on your data.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict future Bitcoin prices.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results

The model's predictions can be visualized using Matplotlib. The prediction results are plotted against the actual prices to evaluate the model's accuracy.
